	  	<div class="section-title-left">Information You Submit to IAP</div>
        <p>It is brought to your notice that IAP collects information provided by you when you use the Site, including, when you submit an online application to become a IAP Visitor, which enables you to utilize a host of services made available by and through the Site; when you submit; when you conduct a IAP Check; or when you contact us with a query, comment, suggestion or request. This can include your: (a) e-mail address; (b) full name; (c) company name; (d) date of birth; (e) original and/or changed password; (f) mailing address; and (h) all information associated with a Search Subject (such as a name, age, or address) that you use to conduct a IAP Check, and the resultant search results. In addition, IAP also stores any reviews or rating that you may attach alongside a certain profile, ID or person search that you may have undertaken for any interaction or services that you may have availed from such a Subject. All the stored information is available for viewing by subsequent Users/Visitor on the Site as also by you, in case you should choose to search for the same person subsequent to the original search transaction or search another person whose search data may have been stored by the Site from a previous search transaction. You agree that such information is available with the Site and is provided to you on a best effort basis and that you will not be relying solely on this information but conduct your own diligence, procedures and tests and observations, as may be required in a situation, to assess dependability ad reliance on a particular subject.</p>
        <div class="section-title-left">Information Collected Automatically About Your Usage of the Site</div>
        <p>We also may collect your name, email ID, age, gender, mobile device's unique identification number. We will also be in a position to collect any precise geo-location information from you or your mobile device after your express consent to such collection.</p>
<p>As a Visitor, please be kindly informed that we gather certain information automatically about your accessing the Site and store it in our log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), date/time, and/or click through data, including which Site link may have brought you to our Site, and/or which were your first and last pages of viewing or usage. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you voluntarily. This is done purely to improve and enhance our Site's effectiveness to you as also to improve our understanding or your needs, and to improve marketing, analytics, and/or site functionality. All this is undertaken to ensure your needs are addressed in a better manner by us.</p>
<p>When you visit the Site, we or our third-party service providers may use a "Cookie" - a small, text-only file that we save to your hard drive - or similar technologies to automatically collect and store non-personally-identifiable information about your usage of the Site such as your IP address, your browser type, the links and items you click on, ad impressions on your web browser, and the web pages you visit. Cookies enhance your experience at the Site, and are in many instances necessary for the provision of Services. For example, we use Cookies to store your password so you don't have to enter it more than once, and to recognize you if you return to the Site using the same web browser.
